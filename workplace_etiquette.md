As part of the Workplace Etiquette module, I examined real-world examples of professional and unprofessional behavior in different workplace scenarios‚Äîsuch as customer interactions, team collaboration, and conflict resolution. Which deepened my understanding of how professionalism influences trust, respect, and career progression. I also reviewed a sample Company Code of Conduct to learn how organizations define professional and ethical standards, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal conduct with company values. To reinforce these lessons, I developed a Professional Behavior Checklist summarizing the key ‚ÄúDo‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts‚Äù of workplace professionalism, focusing on the five main pillars: being polite, accountable, appropriate, ethical, and positive.
